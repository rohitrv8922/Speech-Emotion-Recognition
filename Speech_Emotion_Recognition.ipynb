        "Verbal Communication is valuable and sought after in workplace and classroom environments alike. There is no denying the notion that Indians lack verbal communication and consequently lag behind in the workplace or classroom environments. This happens despite them having strong technical competencies. Clear and comprehensive speech is the vital backbone of strong communication and presentation skills. Where some occupations consist mainly of presenting, most careers require and thrive from the ability to communicate effectively. Research has shown that verbal communication remains one of the most employable skills in both the perception of employers and new graduates. Of the possible improvements to vocal presentations tone, disfluencies, and stutters, in particular, remain one of the most common and prominent factors of someoneâ€™s demonstration. Millions of people are affected by stuttering and other speech disfluencies, with the majority of the world having experienced mild stutters while communicating under stressful conditions. Research shows that mild disfluencies can be cured without medical help, just practicing speech regularly and constructive feedbacks are effective ways to improve. We, Data Scientists recognize this problem and say hello"
